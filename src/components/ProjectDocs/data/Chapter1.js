  *Projects are temporary endeavors undertaken to achieve a specific goal or outcome.*  
          They are unique, non-routine activities designed to create a **product**, **service**, or **result** that is not part of an organizationâ€™s usual operations.  
                  
  **Examples:**  
          - **Product:** A customized vehicle.  
          - **Service:** A consulting project.  
          - **Result:** Improvement in sales/services.

One example of a project is the construction of a new building. This type of project is typically large and complex, involving many different stakeholders, such as architects, engineers, contractors, and construction workers. Such projects may take several years to complete and involve the coordination of many different tasks.

The selection depends on:

          - **Organizational Culture:** A flexible culture supports Agile, whereas a structured environment suits predictive methods.
          - **Risk Assessment:** High-risk projects may require a conservative approach.
          - **Available Resources:** Skilled personnel and budget influence the choice.
